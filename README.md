Processing underinformative 'some' scalar implicatures, relation to autism, and individual differences

This repository contains the data and code for two experiments investigating the relation of 'logical' ('True') judgments of underinformative 'some' scalar implicature statements (e.g. 'some cats are mammals') and autistic-like traits. The second experiment replicated the design of the first experiment, but seeked to further explore the assumption that people divide into two categories in their judgments of such statements. This was done through collectiong of qualitative data (elicitng responses to open-ended questions, reasoning about the underinformative 'some' items).
